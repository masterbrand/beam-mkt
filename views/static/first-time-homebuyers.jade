  p Buying a home for the first time can be an exciting adventure much like a nerve-racking experience of a roller coaster. However, with a little insight, you will understand exactly what you should expect. While the learning curve is often steep, the end result usually provides the financial rewards you need to obtain your first home.Before beginning the process, consider checking your credit score. The higher your score, the better insurance rate you will be offered when searching for financing. Your chosen mortgage lender will determine the available credit they will offer based on your current financial situation. Because of that, tracking your spending over a few months can help you understand your current financial status. The Loan Process There are five components of the loan process when attempting to gain financing for your new home. It includes the application, pre-approval, processing, underwriting and closing stages of the loan. Application Typically, the application process involves a lengthy form that will cover your entire financial situation in complete detail. It will include the name of all parties involved, along with Social Security numbers, current address, date of birth, and current employment information. If the home has already been selected, that address should also be included in the application. In addition, the application will contain essential information that includes: • Total monies deposited in checking accounts • All balances in savings accounts • Stocks, bonds and other investment information • Land ownership • Retirement accounts including IRA and 401(k) • Information on any rental property Pre-approval and Processing Pre-approval involves the mortgage lender’s commitment for issuing a home loan on a pre-selected property. 
  p The mortgage process involves numerous documents. During this stage, you and all other parties involved may be required to submit additional information depending on your financial situation in the type of home loan you are seeking. Remaining organized during this process can make the experience quick and uneventful. Underwriting Near the end stage of the mortgage process, the underwriter – the company that will actually be issuing the loan – will thoroughly review and evaluate your application. This will ensure that the property you wish to acquire is in good shape. In addition, they will evaluate your ability to repay the mortgage debt. Closing During the closing process, you and others purchasing the home, along with the sellers, and possibly your loan expert and/or attorney will schedule a closing date with the title agency. During the closing, everyone involved will sign nearly endless amounts of documents including the settlement statement and the mortgage note. Once all the documentation has been signed, you are officially a first-time home buyer and will receive the keys to your new residence. While the process may seem daunting, if you have good credit and follow a budget, there is a home available in your community that you can afford.
